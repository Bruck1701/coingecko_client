  Keep in mind that this is by no means an oficial gem from Coingecko, it is a MIT license pet project! Use at your own discretion!
  I published it originally with the methods that I needed for another project, but I\'ll keep on adding more methods to interact with the rest of the API. Any comments, sugestions, Pull Requests, feel free to contact me.'
